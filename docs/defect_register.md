# Defect register, and what a failed gate is not

**FURQAN** · *The criterion for energy.*
**MIZAN** · *The balance between energy and water.*

There are two different things in this package that can look alike from a distance, and they should not be confused.

A **defect** is a mistake in the work — a wrong unit, an inverted sign, an unconverged solver. Defects are faults. They get found and fixed, and the count of open ones should be zero.

A **failed gate** is a result. A threshold was fixed in advance, the experiment was run, and the answer came out on the wrong side of it. That is not a fault. Suppressing it would be.

This document lists both, separately, so neither can be mistaken for the other.

## Part 1 — Defects. Ten found, ten fixed, zero open.

| # | Defect | How it showed up | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fan air-flow correlation read as per cent when it takes hertz | The curve turned over at 62 %, so air flow fell as the fan sped up. All three thermal gates failed with a +1.50 K bias. | **Fixed** |
| 2 | Sepiolite used as the magnesium-silicate proxy | Returned indices forbidding operation at every cycle count, against plants demonstrably running 4–5. | **Fixed** — replaced by the empirical Mg × SiO₂ product and the brucite criterion |
| 3 | Carnot-referenced chiller COP | Overstated the value of cooling the condenser by ~60 %. | **Fixed** — replaced by the EnergyPlus bi-quadratic |
| 4 | Chiller coefficients not traced to any machine | Could not be checked by anyone. | **Fixed** — York YT 1758 kW / 6.28 COP, EnergyPlus `Chillers.idf` |
| 5 | Optimiser extrapolating outside the chiller's fitted range | Booked a false 20.41 % water saving that would have flipped a failed gate to passed. | **Fixed** — the entering-condenser window is now a hard constraint; 1,840 of 6,307 candidate points are rejected |
| 6 | Duty fixed point unconverged and seed-dependent | Six substitution steps at 5 mK. Evaporation moved 3.8 % on the choice of seed alone. | **Fixed** — Aitken acceleration with a Brent fallback; 0 of 360 non-converged |
| 7 | Drift eliminator rate 100× too large | `0.0005` used as a fraction — the modern rating of 0.0005 **per cent** with its sign dropped. | **Fixed** — 1×10⁻⁵ in both `tower.py` and `controller.py`, checked by the audit |
| 8 | Simscape temperature sensor read as Celsius when it outputs Kelvin | The chemistry was asked for a saturation pH at 341 °C and the chiller reported itself out of envelope for a whole simulated day. | **Fixed** — explicit conversion block in the diagram |
| 9 | Simscape heat-flow sign inverted | +1000 kW into a 150 t mass for 600 s gave −0.956 K: right magnitude, wrong direction. | **Fixed** — ports swapped, verified against arithmetic |
| 10 | A document existed as two copies | `docs/matlab_model.md` was a manual copy of `matlab/README.md` — identical the day it was made, and guaranteed to go stale the first time either was edited. | **Fixed** — the PDF builds from the original; the audit now rejects duplicated documents |

Three further things were caught during development and are recorded in the code where they happened, but were never in a released result: a contradictory collocation sampler in the surrogate (42 % of points demanded two mutually exclusive constraints), an untrained evaporation head from a loss-scaling error, and an evaporation output whose range could not represent 60 % of its own training data.

**Open defects: none.**

`python src/audit.py` runs 49 checks across code, results and documents and gates the packaging. An inconsistent tree produces no bundle.

## Part 2 — Gate outcomes. Six pass, two fail, both fully diagnosed.

| Gate | Threshold, fixed before fitting | Result | |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 outlet water temperature MAE | ≤ 1.00 K | 0.542 K | **PASS** |
| V1 heat rejection MAPE | ≤ 6.00 % | 5.94 % | **PASS** |
| V2 water consumption MAPE | ≤ 8.00 % | 9.90 % | **FAIL** |
| V5 total cost reduction | ≥ 3 % | 8.55 % | **PASS** |
| V5 makeup water reduction | ≥ 15 % | 14.83 % | **FAIL** |
| V5 skin saturation violations | 0 | 0 | **PASS** |

### V2 — failed, and the cause is now established

The gate compares predicted water consumption against the measured channel. Two explanations were possible and they make **opposite** predictions, which is what made the question answerable:

- an **unaccounted bleed** in the measured channel, which is total water consumption and would include one;
- the **fill characteristic drifting** between campaigns, already documented in the thermal channel.

Re-identifying the fill law on each campaign separately cannot help if the cause is a bleed, because a bleed is a term the model does not contain. It should close the gap if the cause is drift.

| Campaign | Identified c | Evaporation MAPE with its own fill law |
|---|---|---|
| Exp1 | 1.5320 | 6.55 % |
| Exp2 | 1.2401 | 7.80 % |
| Exp3 | 1.3826 | 4.50 % |

**Every campaign falls inside the 8 % gate.** The bleed hypothesis is rejected. The fill coefficient moves **23.5 %** across campaigns spanning four years — the same drift already measured in the thermal channel, now confirmed independently in the water channel.

So V2 fails as a **single-calibration** gate, for a physical reason rather than a modelling one: the gate holds one fill law fixed while the tower itself changed. The model is not deficient; the assumption that a tower's characteristic is a constant is.

That result points the same way as the commercial argument. **Periodic recalibration against the plant's own telemetry is a functional requirement, not an upsell** — and this gate is the measurement of how fast a fixed characteristic goes stale.

Note also that this gate previously read 7.11 % and passed. That pass rested on defect 7, the drift rate a hundred times too large, which was padding the prediction by about five per cent. Fixing a defect turned a pass into a failure. The pass was not real and has been withdrawn.

### V5 water reduction — failed, and the threshold was unreachable

Makeup water is evaporation × C/(C−1), so the saving available from raising cycles of concentration is fixed arithmetic, not a modelling choice:

| Cycles | Makeup saved vs 4 cycles |
|---|---|
| 7 | 12.50 % |
| 8 | 14.29 % |
| **8.5** | **15.00 %** ← the criterion |
| 10 | 16.67 % |
| ∞ | 25.00 % (zero blowdown, the absolute ceiling) |

Gypsum saturates at **8 cycles** on this makeup water, and gypsum saturation is not pH-sensitive, so the acid dose that buys cycles against calcite cannot move it. The criterion required 8.5 cycles. It was written on the far side of a wall that had not been located yet.

The controller reaches 14.83 %, which is more than cycles alone can deliver, because it also lowers evaporation. **No control strategy of any kind reaches 15 % on this water.**

The pre-registration was **mis-specified, not missed**. The lesson is stated in the handoff for the next time: check a threshold against the system's physical ceiling before fixing it.

## Part 3 — Open items that are neither defects nor failed gates

These are things not yet known. Each is stated with the direction it cuts.

| Item | Direction | What would close it |
|---|---|---|
| Almería wet-bulb tops at 21.9 °C; **40.5 % of a Dhahran year is above it** (3,551 of 8,760 h, 84 % of September) | **Unknown** — the only two-sided one, and now sized rather than described | KFUPM's humidifying wind tunnel. Not closable by argument, and the physics-informed surrogate is a mitigation, not a substitute |
| Model error 2.48× measurement uncertainty | Against us | More campaigns, or a better fill model. Reported as a negative result |
| **Skin temperature rise is a hardcoded +8 K.** The film calculation in the codebase gives 2.4-3.7 K clean; 8 K is a fouled surface | **Against us.** A hotter assumed skin makes gypsum look safer, so the 8 K value buys about one cycle of apparent headroom. At a clean 3 K the wall moves from 8 cycles to 7 | `src/skin_sensitivity.py` puts it on the record; the heated-coupon rig measures it |
| Magnesium-silicate SI threshold | Unknown | Handled by the empirical Mg × SiO₂ product instead of asserted |
| OpenModelica leg | Neutral | Written, not installed, not run. Makes no claim |
| **Acid dosing at high cycles may make the water corrosive, and the controller has no corrosion term.** EPRI warns that sulphuric acid replaces protective alkalinity with corrosive sulphate as cycles rise | **Against us.** The optimiser does exactly this: seven cycles plus acid to pH 8.0-8.25 | Potentiostat and coupon work in the KFUPM corrosion laboratory |
| No traction, no LOIs, no patents | Neutral | Customer interviews. Cohort 1 winners had none either |

## What this register is for

A reviewer should be able to ask two questions and get a clean answer to each.

**"Is the work sound?"** Ten defects were found, all ten are fixed, none is open, and a 49-check audit gates every release. Four of the ten were found because a first-principles model refused a bad input rather than absorbing it — which is the argument for building it that way, and the reason the parent company is called Furqan.

**"Did everything work?"** No. Two gates failed. Both are diagnosed to a specific cause with no open questions, neither threshold was moved, and one of them failed precisely *because* a defect was fixed.
